# Pill Box
===========

This is my easy app for tracking medication, including dose and time.

##Summary
After surgery I found it difficult to track when I took which pills, especially as many of them made me quite spacey.  As a user of my Pill Box app you can create a password protected account in which you can enter your medications of any type, the dosage, the timing, and even a physical description.  This can help you schedule out the every four hours meds as easily as the with breakfast or before bed meds.
