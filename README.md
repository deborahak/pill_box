# Pill Box

This is my easy app for tracking medication, including dose and time.

## Summary

After surgery I found it difficult to track when I took which pills, especially as many of them made me quite spacey.  As a user of my Pill Box app you can create a password protected account in which you can enter your medications of any type, the dosage, the timing, and even a physical description.  This can help you schedule out the every four hours meds as easily as the with breakfast or before bed meds.  

## The Future

This is the earliest iteration of this project and there are many attributes and features that I would like to add.  As I move forward I plan to introduce better interactivity, such as being able to click on the medication in the schedule to pull up the medication data.  I would also like to add a picture option to ensure that the pill a person is taking matches the one perscribed, since improperly filled prescriptions can be a serious problem.  
Were I to have greater resources to develope this, I would also find a way to link this app to an alarm feature, so that a user would be alerted to time to take medication and also confirm that the dosage was properly taken.  This could help track drug intake for long term patients and their doctors.
